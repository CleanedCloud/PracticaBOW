# Práctica BOW

[![Skill Icons](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py&perline=2)](https://skillicons.dev)

This project revolves around the exploration and categorization of textual data through Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. By leveraging the Bag of Words (BOW) representation method, we apply the k-means clustering algorithm to segment texts into thematically similar groups. The efficacy of various clustering configurations is gauged using the silhouette coefficient.
